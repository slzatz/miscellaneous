This directory contains some early work on trying to get MQTT working on the esp8266. Has been mostly supplanted by Paul Sokolovsky's work to create a lightweight MQTT client for the esp8266 that I have modified and is `umqtt_client.py`, which is located in directory:

    miscellaneous/esp8266/scrobble_scripts

At the present time, I don't think any active work is going on in this directory.
